# Maze escape project with Turtlebot3

Project for the lecture FWP: ROS in the Deggendorf Institute of Technology for Summer semester 2023

Professor: Dmitrii Dobriborsc

Group participants:
- Gil Angeles
- Ruben Contreras
- Felix Gatti
- Felipe Rojas

## Project description

The project aim is to develop and implement a search or navigationalgorithm that lets the Turtlebot3 solve different kind of mazeconfigurations effectively in a virtual environment.

## General objectives

- Create an environment in Gazebo with a Maze that the Turtlebot3 can explore and solve.​

- Defining a localization/mapping method to navigate the maze in an ordered behaviour.

- Implement a search algorithm for the Turtlebot3 so it can get out of the maze in the fastest way possible.​

- Implement the same algorithm in a Real-world scenario, where a Physical Turtlebot3 is able to solve a simple maze.​
